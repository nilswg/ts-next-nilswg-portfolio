    "As a motivated and skilled full-stack web developer with 2.5 years of development experience.",

    "I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality results, including large-scale business ERP systems and casino web games",

    "Not only am I a self-taught expert, but I also enjoy sharing my knowledge with others. I had introduced new dev-tools to my previous work team, such as Prettier, to improve the quality and readability of the code.
